problemStatement: Machine learning covers a wide range of techniques. There was a need to showcase proficiency in different ML areas and demonstrate how these techniques can solve real-world problems.
solution: Developed a series of projects, each focusing on a different ML aspect. These include spam detection, heart disease prediction, and happiness score analysis, showing practical problem-solving in ML.
features:
  - Advanced spam detection using SVM and text preprocessing
  - Heart disease prediction with multiple classifiers and ensemble methods
  - Linear regression on World Happiness Report data to predict scores
  - Iris species prediction with Random Forest and K-Means clustering
  - Comprehensive model evaluation with metrics and visualizations
technologies:
  - Python
  - Jupyter Notebooks
  - Scikit-learn
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - NLTK
  - SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Means Clustering
