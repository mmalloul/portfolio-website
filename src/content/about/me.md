Hi, I'm Mohammed! As the 'tech guru' in my family, I've always had a knack for technology. My real journey began when a friend introduced me to some fascinating Python projects. That moment sparked my decision to pursue a career in tech. With a bachelor's in Software Engineering from the Applied University of Amsterdam, I now focus on building practical AI and fullstack solutions that help businesses grow. When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading books, working out, and playing video games. I'm passionate about solving problems and continuously learning new things.
