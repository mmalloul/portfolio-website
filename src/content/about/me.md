Hi, I'm Mohammed! As the 'tech guru' in my family, I've always had a knack for technology. My real journey began when a friend introduced me to some fascinating Python projects. That moment sparked my decision to pursue a career in tech.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the Applied University of Amsterdam. My focus now lies in building practical AI and fullstack solutions that drive business growth. When I'm not coding, you can find me buried in books, hitting the gym, or immersed in video games. I'm passionate about problem-solving and expanding my knowledge.

Let's collaborate on exciting projects and create innovative solutions together!
